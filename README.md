# xle-glueworkbench-interface
Illustrates how the Glue semantics workbench (GSWB) can be called from XLE. 
The project contains a sample xle grammar that encodes Glue premises in the f-structure.
The folder /src contains prolog procedures that translate the Glue premises in an f-structure to strings
that are formatted such that they can be read by the Glue semantics workbench. 
The file glue.tcl adds a command to the XLE GUI that allows you to run the PROLOG procedures and the Glue semantics workbench and return the result.

Confirmed functional* for:

- MacOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra) 
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 
- Windows 7



*Given appropriate SWI-Prolog installation and either Oracle Java 1.8 (or higher) or OpenJDK 13 (or OpenJDK > 8) 

# WARNING
- The current version is simply a toy example to illustrate how it can be done. 
- This system is developed on MacOS. Please report compatibility issues with other platforms 

# Requirements
- This project requires an installation of XLE. It is designed to be version independent, but feedback is welcome.
- SWI-Prolog is required for translating f-structure premises to premise strings (The latest stable release is recommended; SWI-Prolog 6.x and older are not compatible with the present system. Currently, there is an issue with the SWI-Prolog website where the download site is marked as dangerous by some browsers).
- Glue semantics workbench .jar file. The best way to get this is by cloning https://github.com/Mmaz1988/GlueSemWorkbench_v2 and 
producing your own .jar file. Since the project has been created with IntelliJ, I recommend to use that editor to build the project.
Alternatively, the .jar file can be downloaded [HERE](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/zymla/glueSemWorkbench2.jar) (Send a reminder if it's not up to date). 
- The GSWB jar file requires Java.Â [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/13/) for Mac works with the jar file made available above. I appreciate feedback for other platforms.

# Running the system
- Download the project to your computer. No specific path is necessary, as long as you have properly set up XLE and SWI-Prolog. This means, you should have added the relevant binaries to your $PATH file, for example, in .bash_profile. For further assistance refer to the respective documentations.

- Put the glueSemWorkbench2.jar file in the top-level project folder, or specify the path in src/glue.tcl, where "Run Java Glue prover" is written.
Replace glueSemWorkbench2.jar with some/directory/glueSemWorkbench2.jar 

```
	#Run Java Glue prover; jar file relative to execution as above 
	eval exec java [list -jar glueSemWorkbench2.jar \
			-i $outputfile -o $displayfile]
```

The next step is to navigate to the top-level folder of the project via the command line (the top level folder contains the xlerc file). 
Then simply run XLE. The result should looke something like the following:

If this suceeds you can simply parse a sentence as usual in XLE.

```
% parse "a man yawned"

The f-structure window "Commands" menu should now contain an entry called "Semantics". Clicking on this button should generate a window which contains the result of the Glue derivation including the underlying premises and their compiled counterpart, the agenda. Note that the example below uses pseudo-semantics to illustrate the functionality of the workbench.
